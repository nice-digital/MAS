                          >hypertension in adults</a
                        >
                        covers diagnosing and managing hypertension. It provides
                        recommendations on when antihypertensive medicines
                        should be offered or considered, monitoring treatment
                        and blood pressure targets.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The NICE guideline recommends a stepped approach to the
                        use of antihypertensives, monotherapy at step 1, dual
                        therapy at step 2 and triple therapy at step 3. If
                        hypertension is not controlled in adults taking optimal
                        tolerated doses of step 3 treatment, then people should
                        be regarded as having resistant hypertension (step 4
                        treatment). For full details on the treatment
                        recommendations see the

                        of day antihypertensives should be taken.

                        A review article summarised results from recent research
                        on timing of administration of antihypertensive
                        medication. It concluded that in general, night-time
                        administration improved overall 24-hour blood pressure
                        profiles regardless of disease comorbidity. However,
                        inconsistencies between studies suggested a need for
                        more prospective randomised controlled trials with
                        sufficient statistical power (<a

                        >). For some types of antihypertensive medication for
                        example, thiazide-like diuretics, it may be necessary to
                        take them in the morning to avoid diuresis interfering
                        with sleep if taken later in the day or at bedtime.

                        types of treatment and make a decision that is right for
                        each person. The NICE guideline also highlights the
                        importance of supporting adherence and ensuring that
                        people with hypertension make the most effective use of

                        groups for mean awake systolic or diastolic blood
                        pressure, but there was a statistically significant
                        lower mean asleep systolic and diastolic blood pressure
                        in the bedtime administration group.

                        There was no statistically significant difference in the
                        frequency of adverse effects (reported by 6.7% and 6.0%
                        of the upon waking and bedtime administration groups
                        respectively, p=0.061), or poor adherence to the
                        allocated treatment schedule (2.8% and 2.9%

                        incidence of adverse events and did not report on
                        specific adverse events such as falls. In addition,
                        adverse events were only recorded if spontaneously
                        reported by participants or revealed through non-direct
                        questioning and physical examination. There was no
                        statistically significant difference between the 2
                        groups for sleep time hypotension (0.3% of all
                        participants).

                        This was a large study with a long duration of
                        follow-up. However, the study authors have highlighted
                        some study limitations. The study population was
                        Caucasian, therefore validation of the results for other
                        ethnic groups is needed. Also, the study did not
                        allocate participants to specific antihypertensive
                        medication therapeutic classes or set medication within
                        each class as treatment was chosen by each participating
                        clinician. For diuretics for instance, at the end of the
                        study, there were more participants taking them in the
                        upon waking group (46.5%) compared with the bedtime
                        administration group (39.5%, p&lt;0.001). Finally, the
                        method by which adverse events were assessed is open to
                        recall bias.

                      <p>
                        This large prospective trial aimed to answer a simple
                        question directly relevant to general practice where
                        there is a lack of good quality evidence. This new
                        evidence suggests that taking the total daily dose of
                        antihypertensive medication at bedtime, compared with in
                        the morning, reduces cardiovascular events and mortality
                        over a mean of 6.3&nbsp;years. A major clinically
                        significant result - but there are caveats.

                      <p>
                        The study included a non-UK (Spanish), Caucasian
                        population and therefore, the findings may not apply to
                        other populations with different sleeping patterns
                        (although participants were encouraged not to sleep in
                        the day) or people with different family origins. The
                        mean age of the cohort was 60.5 years and therefore
                        results may not apply to older cohorts.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As is common in many trials of antihypertensive therapy,
                        patient centred adverse events were poorly reported
                        (sleep disturbance due to nocturia, falls and dizzy
                        episodes due to postural hypotension). These were only
                        collated via spontaneous reports which relies on people
                        remembering to report such events. Assessing this by
                        active questioning would have been preferable.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The classes of drugs prescribed were not blinded and
                        there were differences between the 2&nbsp;study groups
                        with those who took a morning dose more likely to be on
                        diuretics and beta-blockers.

                      <p>
                        Broadly the clinicians appeared to prescribe classes of
                        drugs in the manner of the NICE guidance but the
                        criteria for diagnosing hypertension differed by using
                        not only ambulatory blood pressure monitoring whilst
                        awake but also allowed recruitment of those with raised
                        blood pressure diagnosed using ambulatory blood pressure
                        monitoring whilst asleep. The monitoring period for
                        ambulatory blood pressure in the study was also 48
                        hours.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The NICE guidance makes no recommendation as to when to
                        take antihypertensive medication and it was a question
                        that the development group did not consider.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In conclusion, and despite the limitations discussed
                        above, there may be a potential health gain in switching
                        to a regimen of taking a total daily dose of
                        antihypertensive medication at bedtime. This seems
                        reasonable to do but we should be cautious if
                        considering this in older people, in those at risk of
                        falls and in those in whom such a change may reduce
                        concordance with medication (for example, those taking
                        antihypertensives which may not be suitable for bedtime
                        administration such as diuretics).
